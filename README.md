This is a CLI Trivia Game I've created for a school project using JavaScript. 

- After cloning repo do `npm install`.
- To open the game use `npm start`.
- User should be directed to a Main Menu that includes options to Start Game, See Stats, Reset Stats and Quit.
- The user will be given 10 seconds to answer each question. After each question the timer should reset back to 10. A timer will appear in yellow text.
- If the answer is correct the text "Correct!" should appear in green text.
- If the answer is incorrect the text "Incorrect!" should appear in red text.
- If the user doesn't answer within the time limit then a message "Opps! Out of time!" should appear in red text.
- After the user completes the game a message "You've completed the game!" and be given the option to return to the main menu.
- Afterwards user should be able to navigate to See Stats and ui should display "Correct: #" in green text, "Incorrect: #" in red text, and unanswered in "yellow".
- When the user navigates to the reset stats page and selects "Reset Stats" a success message should appear "Game stats have been reset".
- After user has finished they should be able to exit the game by navigating to "Quit" and pressing enter.
